// to the graph, and store the string and node in the appropriate slot of the
// artist hash table. (A good approach is to create a small class to store the
// name and node together in a slot of the hash table.) Likewise, check if
// {song-name} appears in the song hash table, and if it does not, add a node
// for
// that song to the graph, and store the song name and graph node in the
// appropriate slot of the song hash table. You should print a message if the
// insert causes a hash table to expand in size.

// remove {artist|song}{name}
// Remove the specified artist or song name from the appropriate hash table, and
// remove that node from the graph. Report the outcome (whether the name
// appears,
// and whether it was successfully removed).
//
// print {artist|song|graph}
// Depending on the parameter value, you will print out either a complete
// listing
// of the artists contained in the database, or the songs, or else the graph.
// For
// artists or songs, print the graph: simply move sequentially through the
// associated hash table, retrieving the strings and printing them in the order
// encountered (along with the slot number where it appears in the hash table).
// Then print the total number of artists or total number of songs. When the
// graph
// option is given, you will do the following:
//
// â€¢ Compute connected components on the graph. (You will use the Union/FIND
// algorithm for this purpose, see OpenDSA Module 13.2.) Print out the number of
// connected components, and the number of nodes in the largest connected
// component.
